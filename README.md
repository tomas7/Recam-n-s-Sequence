# About this project
# Recaman's Sequence

This code creates circles according to Recam√°n's Sequence, you can find more about how it works online. 

The sequence can continue indefinitely, but here it is set to stop at a specific index. You can manually stop the sequence and continue with these buttons


## Some features:

### p5 library

### OOP

### Visuals

### Warning: It takes about 10 seconds to start sequence, just wait a bit. (This is due to library loading and that I didn`t optimize it to be published online
